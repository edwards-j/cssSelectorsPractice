/* 

X The header element should have a 1px, goldenrod border. 

X Convert the ul in the navigation element into a series of horizontal links with # as the href value, without bullets, and have some space between them horizontally. 

X Ensure that the navigation is semantically marked as such (i.e. wrap it in the correct HTML tag).

X Any text in an element with class "disabled" should be colored grey, unless it is inside an anchor tag. If inside an anchor, it should be colored purple.

X Any text inside an element with a class of "active" should be colored yellow.

X Section elements should be contained within an article element.

X There are two missing closing tags in this document. Make sure you add them back in.

X Make the "I'm red" text colored red.

X Make the "I'm blue" text colored blue.

X The sibling h4 of the red element should have a background color of red.

X The sibling h4 of the blue element should have background color of blue.

X Any h4 that is a direct child of grandparent should have a 1px border with rounded corners.

X Elements with a class of promo should have bold text that is also colored gold.

X Without adding any other attributes to the input fields in the footer, write a CSS selector that makes any text input field have a height of 25px.
